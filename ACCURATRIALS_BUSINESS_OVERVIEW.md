AccuraTrials - Electronic Data Capture Platform
21 CFR Part 11 Compliant Clinical Trial Management Software

Executive Summary
AccuraTrials is an electronic data capture platform that streamlines clinical trial management while maintaining FDA compliance. Originally built for internal use, we've transformed it into a comprehensive solution that addresses the real pain points of running clinical studies. The platform combines traditional eCRF capabilities with innovative OCR technology to bridge the gap between paper-based and digital workflows.

Core Features

Clinical Trial Management
We handle the entire lifecycle of clinical studies from protocol design through data lock. Our platform manages patient enrollment, tracks study phases, and provides real-time visibility into trial progress. Care indicators automatically flag protocol deviations or missed visits, helping study coordinators stay ahead of issues before they impact data quality.

Electronic Forms and Templates
Creating eCRFs shouldn't require a programming degree. Our drag-and-drop form builder lets clinical teams design complex forms in minutes, not days. We include a library of pre-built templates for common assessments, and everything supports multiple languages including English, Hindi, and Japanese. Built-in validation catches data entry errors before they become problems.

OCR Document Processing
This is where we really shine. Using AWS Textract, we convert existing paper forms into electronic templates automatically. No more recreating forms from scratch or manual data entry marathons. Upload a PDF or scan of any form, and our system identifies fields, checkboxes, and signature blocks, creating a fully functional electronic version. This single feature cuts form migration time by 80% and makes transitioning from paper trials actually feasible.

Compliance and Security
We built AccuraTrials with compliance at its core, not as an afterthought. Every action creates an immutable audit trail with user details, timestamps, and change reasons. Electronic signatures meet 21 CFR Part 11 requirements. Patient data is encrypted and separated from operational data to maintain HIPAA compliance. Role-based permissions ensure users only access what they need.

Why AccuraTrials Makes Sense

The biggest barrier to EDC adoption isn't technology - it's the migration from existing paper processes. Our OCR capability solves this by digitizing your current forms instead of forcing you to recreate them. Setup takes days, not months. The cloud-based architecture means no IT infrastructure to manage. And because we use industry-standard FHIR data formats, integration with existing systems is straightforward.

Japan Market Opportunity
With native Japanese language support and OCR that handles kanji, hiragana, and katakana characters, we're uniquely positioned for the Japanese market. Our compliance framework easily adapts to J-GCP requirements, making us an ideal partner for Japanese CROs and pharmaceutical companies looking to modernize their data capture processes.

Technical Foundation
Built on Google Cloud Platform with Angular and Firebase, AccuraTrials delivers enterprise reliability without enterprise complexity. We maintain 99.9% uptime, scale automatically to handle any study size, and work seamlessly on tablets and mobile devices for bedside data entry.

Getting Started
Implementation typically takes 24-48 hours. We provide virtual training sessions to get your team up to speed quickly. Our support team is available around the clock to ensure your studies run smoothly.
